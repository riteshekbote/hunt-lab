verify_steps: none — awaiting CT enumeration
[PARKED] NONE — no hypotheses generated to critique; confidence threshold 70 not applicable
[FINAL] NONE — 0 survivors; recon prerequisite not met
[NEXT] SCAN: Passive CT + light probe to build inventory (read-only, probe_allow: google|microsoft|azure|live|office|bing|msn):
[LEARN] NONE — no class ACCEPTED/REJECTED @ any asset: insufficient evidence (inventory empty, 0 probes executed)
[RISK] 25 — inventory empty = exposure unmeasured; program scope is high-value (Google/Microsoft bounty, OAuth/Azure AD, cloud metadata SSRF potential) but no live anomalies observed this cycle. Risk reflects pre-recon uncertainty, not exploit status.

[PARKED] NONE — no hypotheses generated to critique (confidence <70 / REJECTED list / missing verify_steps filters not applicable)
[FINAL] NONE — 0 surviving hypotheses (insufficient evidence, inventory empty)
[NEXT] SCAN: Passive CT + light probe to build inventory (read-only, probe_allow: google|microsoft|azure|live|office|bing|msn):
[LEARN] NONE — no class ACCEPTED/REJECTED @ any asset: insufficient evidence (inventory empty, 0 probes executed) — matches KNOWLEDGE BASE 2026-08-27
[RISK] 5 reason: Overall exposure indeterminate — 0 hosts probed, 0 evidence of auth/GraphQL/SSRF/IDOR surface. Risk cannot be assessed until CT inventory + status/header anomaly pass completed for google.com / microsoft.com / azure.com scope. No high-value live hosts confirmed.
